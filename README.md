👋 Hi, I'm Kathy.

I'm a Technical Writer. 

🚶‍♀️:seedling:🌺🎨 

I enjoy walking, taking photos of street art and flowers, drawing, painting and digital design. Check out some of my art and infographics projects on my personal website www.quillshadow.com. 

👾 :writing_hand: 

I'm currently learning about API docs, Docs-as-code, HTML/CSS, SVG, and web animation technologies.
