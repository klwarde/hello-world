# hello-world
This is my first repository! What shall I put in it?

I am a **technical writer**. 

I enjoy urban exploring and taking photos of street art and flowers. Aside from photography, I like to draw and paint, and pursue my own digital design projects using Photoshop and Illustrator. You can see some of my art and infographics projects on my personal website www.quillshadow.com. 

My current technical interests include API docs, Docs-as-code, HTML/CSS, SVG, and web animation technologies.
